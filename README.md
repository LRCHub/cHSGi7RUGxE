[00:02.46] Only in hope lies salvation
[00:05.08] Do you hear my voice calling?
[00:07.57] Then you'll find hope is coming to this world
[00:12.53] In the light
[00:18.53] 
[00:25.70] Like a stray sheep or a lost child
[00:28.63] Everybody seems to lose their way
[00:35.91] Like God says that throughout history
[00:38.62] Some things just always remain unchanged
[00:58.62] 
[00:45.13] No one knows what tomorrow may bring
[00:50.04] But if you want something, you can rely on
[01:11.04] 
[00:58.04] Only in hope lies salvation
[01:00.51] Do you hear my voice calling?
[01:03.06] Like a bell ringing out
[01:05.18] To mark the day your fate has come
[01:22.18] 
[01:08.06] Only in hope lies salvation
[01:10.69] Can you see these two colored eyes?
[01:13.17] Then you'll find hope is coming to this world
[01:18.26] In the light
[01:24.26] 
[01:31.78] People only seem so downed
[01:34.24] As if troubled by endless rainy days
[01:41.82] Like God says, it's always like this
[01:44.22] No one ever sees the route they have
[02:02.22] 
[01:50.78] No one else can set you free
[01:55.87] But if you have the will to struggle along
[02:16.87] 
[02:03.74] Only with hope you'll find a way
[02:06.26] Can you open up your eyes?
[02:08.75] See the light
[02:10.04] Let it guide you towards your future
[02:28.04] 
[02:13.80] Only with hope you'll find a way
[02:16.46] Are you ready to beat fear?
[02:18.71] It's up to you if you want to break free
[02:23.87] From the night
[02:30.87] 
[02:46.43] This walk continues on its path
[02:49.28] No one can never stop it now
[02:51.71] Only you have the power
[02:53.94] To make change for yourself
[03:07.44] 
[02:56.82] Only in hope lies salvation
[02:59.31] Do you hear my voice calling?
[03:01.76] Like a bell ringing out
[03:03.76] To mark the day your fate has come
[03:20.76] 
[03:06.85] Only in hope lies salvation
[03:09.41] Can you see these two colored eyes?
[03:11.87] Then you'll find hope is coming to this world
[03:16.82] In the light
