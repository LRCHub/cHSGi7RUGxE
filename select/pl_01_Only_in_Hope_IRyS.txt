Only in hope lies salvation.
Do you hear my voice calling?
Then you'll find hope is coming
to this world in the light
Like a stray sheep
or a lost child,
everybody seems
to lose their way
My god says that
throughout history some things
just always remain unchanged
No one knows
what tomorrow may bring
But if you want something
you can rely on... (yeah)
Only in hope lies salvation.
Do you hear my voice calling?
Like a bell ringing out to mark
the day your fate has come
Only in hope lies salvation.
Can you see these two
colored eyes?
Then you'll find hope is coming
to this world in the light
People always seem so down,
as if troubled
by endless rainy days
My god says
it's always like this,
no one ever sees the wealth
they have
No one else can set you free
But if you have the will
to struggle alone… (yeah)
Only with hope
you'll find a way.
Can you open up your eyes?
See the light,
let it guide you towards
your future
Only with hope
you'll find a way.
Are you ready to beat fear?
It's up to you,
if you want to break free
from the night
This world continues
on its path.
No one can ever stop it now
Only you have the power
to make change for yourself
Only in hope lies salvation.
Do you hear my voice calling?
Like a bell ringing out to mark
the day your fate has come
Only in hope lies salvation.
Can you see these two
colored eyes?
Then you'll find hope is coming
to this world in the light
